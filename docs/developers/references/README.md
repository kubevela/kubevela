# KubeVela Workload Types and Traits References.

Note: All the contents under this directory are designed to be referenced by other documentations as the full schema or usage of specific workload types or traits.. 

In the upcoming releases, we plan to auto-generate all these reference documentations from the CUE templates in KubeVela's definition objects.
