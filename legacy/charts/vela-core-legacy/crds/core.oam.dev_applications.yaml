                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                    usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual
                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                    like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\"
                    or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be well described
                    when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                    are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct
                    is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                    numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. \n Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:

                          uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty
                          describing its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.
                          \ It includes many fields which are not generally honored.
                          \ For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very
                          rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                          is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.
                          \ In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                          like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not
                          honored\" or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be
                          well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.
                          \ Because the usages are different, the validation rules
                          are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to
                          predict what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise
                          and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a
                          URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation and
                          require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                          on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual
                          struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because
                          this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this
                          type will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs
                          embed an underspecified API type they do not control. \n

                          used type that is well-focused on your reference. For example,

                              For example, if the object reference is to a container
                              within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                              (where "name" refers to the name of the container that
                              triggered the event) or if no container name is specified
                              "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this

                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                    usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual
                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                    like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\"
                    or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be well described
                    when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                    are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct
                    is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                    numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. \n Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:

                          uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty
                          describing its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.
                          \ It includes many fields which are not generally honored.
                          \ For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very
                          rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                          is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.
                          \ In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                          like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not
                          honored\" or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be
                          well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.
                          \ Because the usages are different, the validation rules
                          are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to
                          predict what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise
                          and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a
                          URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation and
                          require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                          on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual
                          struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because
                          this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this
                          type will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs

                          used type that is well-focused on your reference. For example,

                              JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                              For example, if the object reference is to a container
                              within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                              (where "name" refers to the name of the container that
                              triggered the event) or if no container name is specified
                              "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this
