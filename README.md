## Introduction

KubeVela is a modern application delivery platform that makes deploying and operating applications across today's hybrid, multi-cloud environments easier, faster and more reliable.

![kubevela](docs/resources/what-is-kubevela.png)

## Highlights

KubeVela practices the "render, orchestrate, deploy" workflow with below highlighted values added to existing ecosystem:

* Deployment as Code

Declare your deployment plan as workflow, run it automatically with any CI/CD or GitOps system, extend or re-program the workflow steps with CUE. No add-hoc scripts, no dirty glue code, just deploy. The deployment workflow in KubeVela is powered by [Open Application Model](https://oam.dev/).

* Built-in security and compliance building blocks

Choose from the wide range of LDAP integrations we provided out-of-box, enjoy multi-cluster authorization that is fully automated, pick and apply fine-grained RBAC modules and customize them per your own supply chain requirements.

* Multi-cloud/hybrid-environments app delivery as first-class citizen

Progressive rollout across test/staging/production environments, automatic canary, blue-green and continuous verification, rich placement strategy across clusters and clouds, fully managed cloud environments provision.
