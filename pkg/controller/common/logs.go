// klog has multiple levels, you can set the log levels by klog.V()
// Basic examples:
//
//	klog.V(1).Info("Prepare to repel boarders")
//
//	klog.V(2).ErrorS(err, "Initialization failed")
const (
	// LogInfo level is for most info logs, this is the default
	// One should just call Info directly.
	LogInfo int = iota

	// LogDebug is for more verbose logs
	LogDebug

	// LogDebugWithContent is recommended if one wants to log with the content of the object,
	// ie. http body, json/yaml file content
	LogDebugWithContent

	// LogTrace is the most verbose log level, don't add anything after this
	LogTrace = 100
