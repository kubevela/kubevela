### Commit Conventions

KubeVela follows the [conventional-commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and [commit messages best practices](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) to improve better history information.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <subject>

[optional body]
```

#### Examples:

Commit message with scope:

```
Feat(lang): add polish language
```

Commit message with no body:

```
Docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG
```

Commit message with multi-paragraph body:

```
Fix: correct minor typos in code

see the issue for details

on typos fixed.

Reviewed-by: Z
Refs #133
```

#### `<type>` (required)

Type is required to better capture the area of the commit, based on the [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

We capitalize the `<type>` to make sure the subject line is capitalized. `<type>` can be one of the following:

* **Feat**: A new feature
* **Fix**: A bug fix
* **Docs**: Documentation only changes
* **Build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies 
* **Style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **Refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **Perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **Test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
* **Chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

#### `<scope>` (optional)

Scope is optional, it may be provided to a commitâ€™s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, it is could be anything specifying place of the commit change. Github issue link is
also a valid scope. For example: Fix(cli), Feat(api), Fix(#233), etc.

You can use `*` when the change affects more than a single scope.

#### `<subject>` (required)

The subject MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code changes, e.g., "Fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string", instead of "Fix: bug".

#### `<body>` (optional)

A longer commit body may be provided after the short subject, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.
